# Steve Jobs Beat Tim Cook
I don't believe old thing is always bad, new thing is always good. Actually I believe:

>a company too far to the left will constantly be changing (deprecating much loved services), over diversify its interests (ignoring or being ashamed of its core business), and overly trust its employees and competitors. 

Let's see what if Steve Jobs is after Tim Cook, how things will happen?


| Tim Cook      | Steve Jobs  |
|-------------:| -----:|
| iPhone is laggy   | iPhone getting smoother and smoother  |
| use flat design   | use skeuomorphism |
| ipad is thick   |  provide thinner iPad |
| macbook air doesn't has Apple logo   |  now we have shiny Apple logo light back on the macbook air  |
| iPhone is 5inch big   | We don't provide stupid big screen iPhone  |
|    |   |
|    |   |
